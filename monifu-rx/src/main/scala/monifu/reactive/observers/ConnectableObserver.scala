/**
 * Wraps an [[Observer]] into an implementation that abstains from emitting items until the call
 * to `connect()` happens. Prior to `connect()` it's also a [[Channel]] into which you can enqueue
 * events for delivery once `connect()` happens, but before any items
 * emitted by `onNext` / `onComplete` and `onError`.
 *
 * Example: {{{
 *   val obs = ConnectableObserver(observer)
 *
 *   // schedule onNext event, after connect()
 *   obs.onNext("c")
 *
 *   // schedule event "a" to be emitted first
 *   obs.pushNext("a")
 *   // schedule event "b" to be emitted second
 *   obs.pushNext("b")
 *
 *   // underlying observer now gets events "a", "b", "c" in order
 *   obs.connect()
 * }}}
 *
 * Example of an observer ended in error: {{{
 *   val obs = ConnectableObserver(observer)
 *
 *   // schedule onNext event, after connect()
 *   obs.onNext("c")
 *
 *   obs.pushNext("a") // event "a" to be emitted first
 *   obs.pushNext("b") // event "b" to be emitted first
 *
 *   // schedule an onError sent downstream, once connect()
 *   // happens, but after "a" and "b"
 *   obs.pushError(new RuntimeException())
 *
 *   // underlying observer receives ...
 *   // onNext("a") -> onNext("b") -> onError(RuntimeException)
 *   obs.connect()
 *
 *   // NOTE: that onNext("c") never happens
 * }}}

/**
 * A safe observer ensures two things:
 *
 * - errors triggered by downstream observers are caught and streamed to `onError`,
 *   while the upstream gets an `Ack.Cancel`, to stop sending events
 *
 * - once an `onError` or `onComplete` was emitted, the observer no longer accepts
 *   `onNext` events, ensuring that the Rx grammar is respected.
 *
 * This implementation doesn't address multi-threading concerns in any way.

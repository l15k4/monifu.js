/**
 * Represents a composite of multiple cancelables. In case it is canceled, all
 * contained cancelables will be canceled too, e.g...
 * {{{
 *   val s = CompositeCancelable()
 *
 *   s += c1
 *   s += c2
 *   s += c3
 *
 *   // c1, c2, c3 will also be canceled
 *   s.cancel()
 * }}}
 *
 * Additionally, once canceled, on appending of new cancelable references, those
 * references will automatically get canceled too:
 * {{{
 *   val s = CompositeCancelable()
 *   s.cancel()
 *
 *   // c1 gets canceled, because s is already canceled
 *   s += c1
 *   // c2 gets canceled, because s is already canceled
 *   s += c2
 * }}}
 *
 * Adding and removing references from this composite is thread-safe.
